<h3 align="center">Collaboration between CMU and IST</h3>


<h3 align="left">Division:</h3>

- **Distributed Consider EKF for a 4 Cubesat Formation w/ Deputies having Relative Range Meas. and a Chief with GPS Meas. - Includes Dynamics with Gravity,J2 Perturbations and Spacecraft Drag with an Exponential Atmosphere model.**
- **Event-Trigger variant of the Proposed Distributed Filter for Sensor Selection and Communication Channel Optimization based on the CrÃ¡mer-Rao Lower Bound and proportional Confidence Levels, that the user defines to balance the ratio between accuracy and communication optimization.**

<h3 align="left">Key Facts:</h3>


- **The Measurement Model is Range-only between them and state model is Pos.+Vel. in km & km/s for Deputies and a Hub Spacecraft with GPS Measurements only;**

- **The Dynamics Model is made by the author w/ J2 and Drag, that includes also the jacobians;**
